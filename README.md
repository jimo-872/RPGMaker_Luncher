# RPG Maker Universal Launcher

A lightweight launcher for RPG Maker MV/MZ games that allows you to manage and play multiple games using a single NW.js runtime, helping you save significant disk space.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Please read the following carefully before using this software.**

### 1. Use at Your Own Risk (No Warranty)
This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The developer makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the safety, suitability, lack of viruses, inaccuracies, typographical errors, or other harmful components of this software. There are inherent dangers in the use of any software, and you are solely responsible for determining whether this software is compatible with your equipment and other software installed on your equipment.

### 2. File Modification & Data Liability
This launcher includes features that perform file operations on your computer, specifically the **"Clean Up" (Slim)** feature, which deletes redundant NW.js executable files from game directories.
*   **Backup Required**: You are strongly advised to backup your game folders before performing any cleanup or modification operations.
*   **Liability**: The developer shall not be held liable for any data loss, file corruption, or game instability resulting from the use of this tool.

### 3. Runtime Compatibility
This tool runs games using a generic, shared NW.js environment. While it is designed to work with standard RPG Maker MV/MZ titles, it may not be compatible with games that rely on:
*   Specific legacy versions of NW.js.
*   Custom native extensions (`.node` modules).
*   Heavily modified engine cores.

**Recommendation**: We suggest testing starting from **NW.js v0.55** and going downwards if stability issues occur, as newer versions may conflict with older RPG Maker MV plugins.

This project is an unofficial, open-source tool created by the community. It is **not** affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or connected to **Gotcha Gotcha Games**, **KADOKAWA**, or the **RPG Maker** franchise. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.
